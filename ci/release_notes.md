# Improvements

- Added automatic "feature" for users_file

  By specifying `params.users_file`, you can specify a file that contains
  the desired uses array, which can be shared independent of hierarchy.

# Software Upgrades

* This version uses jumpbox-boshrelease v4.7.8, which bumps genesis from
  2.7.10 to 2.7.11
